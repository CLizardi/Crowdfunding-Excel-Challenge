•	Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
-	Crowdfunding was successful 56% out of the time, failed 36% of the time, and cancelled all together 5% of the time. 
-	Crowdfunding has a higher success rate during peak summer-June and July. This may also correlate with a high success rate with categories such as film & video, music, and theater rather than journalism, games, and photography.
-	A successful crowdfund campaign is more than likely to occur in the summer, but investors might have a hard time choosing a category since the odds of success are a bit more than half which might be a hard sell to some.

•	What are some limitations of this dataset?
-	Although, countries are listed on the initial sheet it would be nice to know what states or provinces (depending on the country) had a higher success rate. In the case of the states, which has the highest percentage funded by country, if seasonal weather conditions have any significance, would a state such as FL have a high success rate due to its summer like conditions all year-round vs a seasonal area, mostly cold states such as Michigan, Illinois etc. 
-	What is the correlation between success and failure? Is it more than just meeting a goal? For example, are the successful ones more of an event or once in a lifetime experience. What makes them successful? The failures, where was their fall from grace? Lack of marketing, bad weather? I believe without a useful data set to correlate the two it can make crowdfund investor either go all in or walk away as fast as they can. 

•	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?
-	A Clustered 2d column would work especially if you’re categorizing by outcome or funded by country. This may provide additional value if somebody is looking to make the crowdfund investment in the states.
-	A 2d Line chart with markers to show and emphasis trends in the months of a year.
-	A pie chart may work as well since it would be fairly easy to determinate which row labels (sub category or parent) would fill out most which may be easier for your eyes to read.

•	Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median better summarizes the data.
-	I believe the median would the best way to summarize the data. I think it would be less affected by anomalies or outliers

•	Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?
-	I believe there’s more variability for successful campaigns as such successful campaigns such as film & video, music and theater as it can be easier broken down into macro categories with a higher chance of success. For example – Music can be hip hop, dance music, country etc. Theater can be stand up comedy, operas, solo theater, immersive theater etc
-	It makes sense since these are popular industries that make up the fabric of community. Community brings people together and there’s no better outings than the summertime community events. I believe this is an accurate representation of the data presented.
